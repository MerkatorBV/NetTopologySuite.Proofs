   ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Shewchuk's nonoverlapping relation, Priest's stronger component condition,
   and where the corpus's own half-ulp predicate sits among them.

   CONTEXT.  `fast_expansion_sum_nonoverlap_shewchuk` is archived
   false-as-stated (RESOLVED-VIA-ABORT, Qed-closed disproof in
   B64_Shewchuk_Thm13_counterexample.v).  Its Abort note says: "To recover a
   TRUE general headline, weaken nonoverlap_strict to the bit-disjoint
   predicate and re-aim the pathA-OR-pathB obligations."

   A NAMING CORRECTION, deliberate.  That note says "bit-disjoint", but the
   relation Shewchuk actually defines is NOT disjointness of bit positions --
   it is a statement about bit RANGES.  Formally (1997 p. 309 n. 2):

     "x and y are nonoverlapping if there exist integers r and s such that
      x = r 2^s and |y| < 2^s, or y = r 2^s and |x| < 2^s."

   Take x = 2^8 + 1 and y = 2^4.  No bit position is shared, so they are
   bit-disjoint in the naive sense; but x is odd, forcing s = 0, and
   |y| = 16 < 2^0 fails.  They OVERLAP in Shewchuk's sense.  This module
   therefore uses `nonoverlapping`, matching the paper, and does not repeat
   the Abort note's wording.

   PHILOSOPHY (do not overclaim).  This file does NOT prove that
   `fast_expansion_sum` preserves anything; `fast_expansion_sum` does not
   appear in it.  The lane's stop condition (QED or QEX) is NOT met here --
   what is delivered is the predicate layer that a preservation attempt needs,
   plus the measured separations between the three predicates.  See
   docs/thm13-priest-route.md, which also records that obtaining Priest 1991
   is the first task on this route.  IT HAS SINCE BEEN OBTAINED
   (doi:10.1109/ARITH.1991.145549, 2026-09-05), which removes the guesswork an
   earlier draft of this file needed.

   Two things that guess got wrong, now corrected from the paper:

     - Priest's component condition is a gap of t DIGITS between exponents,
       not a one-bit slack on Shewchuk's exponent.  It is stated below as
       `priest_nonoverlapping_R` and proved strictly stronger than Shewchuk's
       footnote-2 relation.  `overlap_within 1` survives only as one instance
       of a parameterised family that makes the ordering lemma cheap; no
       instance of it is Priest's bound.
     - Priest's standing hypothesis is FAITHFUL arithmetic (his §2), which is
       weaker than IEEE-754 round-to-even.  That is the "general conditions"
       Shewchuk alludes to without naming.

   And the paper's load-bearing result for overlay turns out not to be the
   expansion invariant at all.  It is §7: an algorithm that decides whether a
   segment meets a line and returns the correctly rounded intersection point
   in the INPUT precision.  That is a CONSTRUCTOR, not a predicate, and
   nothing in this file formalises it.

   What IS established, all Qed:

     priest_nonoverlapping  =>  nonoverlapping  =>  overlap_within 1
       Priest 1991 §2, gap t       Shewchuk n.2        one-bit slack

     strict_succ (half-ulp)  =>  nonoverlapping
           corpus's own            Shewchuk n.2

   Every link is STRICT, and the same pair witnesses all three:
   256 = 2^52 * 2^-44 and 1 = 2^52 * 2^-52.  It is nonoverlapping at
   s = -44, it is not half-ulp separated (that is the Theorem 13
   counterexample), and its exponent gap is 8 where Priest demands 53.
   `predicate_hierarchy_strict` carries the two lower links,
   `priest_hierarchy_strict` the top one.

   with BOTH links shown strict by explicit witnesses:
     - (256, 1)   fails strict_succ, satisfies nonoverlapping
                  -- the pair that refuted the Theorem 13 headline;
     - (256, 256) fails nonoverlapping, satisfies overlap_within 1.

   AXIOM FOOTPRINT, measured 2026-09-09 on Rocq 9.2.0 + Flocq 4.2.2 by the
   `Print Assumptions` block at the end of this file, not by prose.  Ten of
   the fifteen headlines are LEM-free, resting only on
   `ClassicalDedekindReals.sig_forall_dec` and
   `FunctionalExtensionality.functional_extensionality_dep`.  Five carry
   `Classical_Prop.classic` as well, and the split is not arbitrary: every
   one of the five routes through `strict_succ_b64`, the corpus's own
   half-ulp predicate, which reaches `b64_format_B2R` (= Flocq's
   `generic_format_B2R`) and `b64_ulp_FLT_0`.  The five are

       strict_succ_b64_nonoverlapping   nonoverlap_strict_chain
       strict_succ_overlap_within_1     predicate_hierarchy_strict
       thm13_witness_nonoverlapping

   `classic` is inherited there, not introduced here, and the module is
   listed in docs/audit-exceptions.txt for that reason.

   Worth stating plainly, because it is the one thing this file settles that
   prose could not: PRIEST'S WHOLE LINK IS LEM-FREE.  `priest_nonoverlapping_weaker`,
   `normalised_exponent_unique`, `priest_nonoverlapping_b64_256_1_false` and
   `priest_hierarchy_strict` are all in the clean ten.  The excluded middle
   enters only where the corpus's half-ulp predicate does.

(* --------------------------------------------------------------------------
   PRIEST'S COMPONENT CONDITION -- now taken from the paper, not paraphrased.

   Priest 1991 §2, obtained 2026-09-05 (doi:10.1109/ARITH.1991.145549):

     "writing x_i = m_i b^{k_i} with b^{t-1} <= |m_i| < b^t, we require that
      k_i - k_j >= t for i < j.  (In other words, if i < j then the most
      significant digit of x_j is at least one order of magnitude smaller
      than the least significant digit of x_i.)"

   This is bit-RANGE disjointness with a full-precision gap, and it is
   STRICTLY STRONGER than Shewchuk's footnote-2 relation above.  Worked
   separation at t = 8: x = 256, y = 129.  Shewchuk holds (256 = 1*2^8 and
   |129| < 2^8).  Priest fails: normalised, 256 = 128*2^1 so k_x = 1, and 129
   is odd so k_y = 0, giving k_x - k_y = 1 < 8.

   The pair (256, 1) satisfies BOTH: 1 = 128*2^-7, so k_x - k_y = 8 >= 8.
   The Theorem 13 witness therefore survives Priest's condition as well.

   NOTE ON WHAT REPLACED WHAT.  An earlier draft of this module guessed
   Priest's bound as "one bit of slack on Shewchuk's exponent"
   (`overlap_within 1`), from Shewchuk's one-sentence summary.  With the paper
   in hand that guess is simply wrong -- Priest's condition is a gap of t
   digits, not a slack of one.  `overlap_within` is kept below only as the
   parameterised family that makes the ordering lemma cheap; no instance of it
   is claimed to be Priest's.
