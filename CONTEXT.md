# NetTopologySuite.Proofs

A Rocq/Coq proof corpus accompanying NetTopologySuite, plus the differential
tooling that compares real geometry engines (NTS, GEOS) against the extracted
oracle and pictures the cases under scrutiny.

## Language

### Arrangement vocabulary

Per **ADR-0007**. Each term names one thing precisely; the short name is the
one to use in issue titles and lemma names, the gloss is what it means. None
of these exist as types in the corpus yet -- ADR-0007 is *Proposed*.

**Sheet**:
An oriented affine plane `(O; e1, e2)` with an optional lattice (the snap
grid). All coordinates are points of one sheet, and a constructor runs on
exactly one. Changing the sheet or the lattice is a different instance. This
is the envelope JTS leaves unnamed when it stores a bare `Coordinate` and
later attaches a scale.
_Avoid_: precision model, coordinate system (both name only part of it)

**Hen**:
A stable identifier with decidable equality. A hen owning a point is a
vertex; a hen owning an egg is a curve piece. Identity of vertices is a
property of the hen, **not** of its coordinates -- which is the whole point:
`Dart := (Point * Point)` makes two coincident crossings rounded to different
floats into two darts that `dart_eq_dec` correctly reports as distinct.
_Avoid_: vertex, node, id (each is a role a hen plays, not the thing)

**Egg**:
The interpolant `gamma : [0,1] -> sheet` of a named class (chord, circular
arc, clothoid, sinusoid, ellipse, Bezier, NURBS), supporting `eval`,
`tangent`, curvature where defined, `split` and `demote`.
_Avoid_: curve, segment (both are classes of egg, not the concept)

**Chicken**:
Incidence, and only incidence: a directed use `(h_src, h_dst, egg)` of an egg
between two hens. Its twin reverses orientation. A hen incident to no chicken
is **vacant**.
_Avoid_: edge, half-edge, dart (dart is the corpus's current, coordinate-
carrying approximation of a chicken)

**Cook**:
A constructor: a partial function that allocates hens. The primitive is the
pairwise intersection oracle, which returns a point plus its two parameters,
or the empty set, or **declines**. The cook is the only way a new hen appears.
Priest 1991 §7 is a cook for a line and a segment in floating point.
_Avoid_: noder, intersector (these name implementations of one cook)

**Decline**:
The oracle was undefined for this pair, or the inputs are not on one sheet.
**Not** an empty geometry, not `EMPTY`, not a value in SQL/MM. Distinguish
sharply from a completed cook that left no hens, which *is* the empty
point-set (dimension -1, union identity, intersection zero).
_Avoid_: empty, null, failure (the first is a different result, the others
lose the distinction)

**View**:
A function from leftover hens to a wire format -- WKT, WKB, SFA class names,
SQL/MM type tags. `POINT EMPTY` is a tag a view chooses for a vacant result
whose caller expected a point; the kernel does not store it. The SFA type
zoo lives here, not in the kernel.
_Avoid_: geometry type, output format

### Abbreviations

The initialisms that carry the most weight in the corpus. If a term you need is
not here, that is a signal — see `docs/agents/domain.md`.

**JCT**:
The **Jordan curve theorem**. In this corpus it names a *polygonal* statement:
the correspondence `point_in_ring` ⟺ `geometric_interior` for rings
(`point_in_ring_correct`), not the classical theorem for arbitrary simple closed
curves. The corpus does not prove classical JCT and does not depend on it. Note
`coq-fourcolor`'s `planar_Jordan` is a *combinatorial* Jordan property (no
Moebius paths in planar hypermaps) and is not this statement either — see
`docs/ecosystem-search-2026-05-29.md`.
_Avoid_: Jordan (unqualified), Jordan curve theorem (when the polygonal
statement is meant)

**DCEL**:
**Doubly connected edge list** — the half-edge structure the face-extraction and
ray-parity machinery walk (`dart`, `next`, `face`, orbits). `coq-fourcolor`'s
`Record hypermap` with its three mutually-inverse permutations is equivalent to
it.
_Avoid_: quad-edge (that is Guibas–Stolfi's structure, which this corpus does
not use)

**QED ∨ QEX**:
The disjunctive stop condition for a lane: it closes either by a completed proof
(**QED**) or by a **documented counterexample** (**QEX**). Both are green; a
refutation that is Qed-closed and registered is a result, not a failure.
_Avoid_: failed, blocked (for a QEX outcome)

**RGR**:
The slice pattern: Read (grep fallback) → Red (analytical test) → Green (minimal
reuse) → Refactor (tiny + comment) → Pin + Cake + oracle match → Accept.
_Avoid_: red-green-refactor (the corpus's cycle has six steps, not three)

**MIC**:
**Maximum inscribed circle** — the largest disk contained in a region, with both
the containment and the maximiser (`MaximumInscribedCircle.v`, board #9004).

**LEC**:
**Largest empty circle** — the largest disk avoiding a point set
(`LargestEmptyCircle.v`, board #9006 for the medial-axis lane).

**PIA**:
**Pole of inaccessibility** — the point furthest from a shoreline. The
authoritative definition (Garcia-Castellanos & Lombardo 2007,
doi:10.1080/14702540801897809) is **on the sphere**; this corpus is planar
throughout, so plane MIC/LEC ≠ spherical PIA. The spherical gap is board #9005.
_Avoid_: treating PIA and LEC centre as interchangeable outside the planar
teaching instance

### Curve types

topic: docs
topics: relate, binary64, arc, overlay
claimId: none
witness: none
macro: none
mutation-seed: 890884
issue: none

Abbreviations are **shared with the `grootstebozewolf/jts` fork** so a table can be
read across both trackers. The initials always match the type: CS is the type
starting "Circular", CC the one starting "Compound".

| Abbrev | Type | JTS | NTS |
|---|---|---|---|
| CS | CircularString | `geom/curve/CircularString.java` | `Geometries/Curves/CircularString.cs` |
| CC | CompoundCurve | `geom/curve/CompoundCurve.java` | `Geometries/Curves/CompoundCurve.cs` |
| CP | CurvePolygon | `geom/curve/CurvePolygon.java` | `Geometries/Curves/CurvePolygon.cs` |
| Multi | MultiCurve / MultiSurface | `geom/curve/MultiCurve.java` | `Geometries/Curves/MultiCurve.cs` |
| Arc | CircularArc | *(no class — a Proofs primitive)* | — |

**CircularString (CS)**:
One curve geometry made of a run of circular arcs, each sharing an endpoint with
the next; WKT `CIRCULARSTRING`, 2n+1 points. A *sequence*, so a single-arc fact
reaches it only through a concatenation argument.
_Avoid_: CC (the fork and this repo both mean CompoundCurve), arc, Arc

**CompoundCurve (CC)**:
One curve geometry whose members are contiguous LineStrings and CircularStrings
joined head to tail. Mixed linear and curved by construction.
_Avoid_: CS (means CircularString), compound, curve chain

**CircularArc (Arc)**:
This corpus's **primitive** — a single arc, not a geometry type. It has no WKT
keyword and no class in any engine. An Arc theorem is not a CS theorem.
_Avoid_: CircularString, CS, arc geometry

**CurveCollection**:
**Retired — the type does not exist.** No such class in JTS, GEOS or NTS
(verified 2026-08-22: zero matching files in all three trees). It appeared as a
`CC` column heading in the coverage matrix and in Slice 10 prose; both were
naming a type no engine has. Say Multi (for member recursion) or CC
(for CompoundCurve), whichever the evidence actually covers.
_Avoid_: CC, curve collection, collection of curves

### Curve conformance

Per **ADR-0005**, the SQL/MM curve types conform at the boundary and
normalize inside: say which side of the intake/validity line a check lives on.

**Intake**:
What constructors and readers reject: only what makes a value
unrepresentable — point-count shape, component contiguity, ring closure.
Everything accepted is representable; everything rejected carries a clause
citation. A value can pass intake and still be invalid.
_Avoid_: validation, well formed (as a constructor claim)

**ISO validity**:
Every spec "shall" beyond representability, owned by arc-aware `ST_IsValid`:
implemented rules answer definite-false naming their clause; unimplemented
rules fail closed (throw naming the missing rung) — never an unchecked
`true`.
_Avoid_: invalid (for merely un-checked values), IsValid returns true (until
the rung that checks it lands)

### Exact curves

**Bible**:
The governing architecture document for exact curve work — `doc/EXACT_CURVE_BIBLE.md`
(*JTS Arc-Native Programme*, canonical August 2026) on the `feature/sfa-curve-rgr`
branch of the `grootstebozewolf/jts` fork. It is in neither this repo nor the fork's
default branch, so cite it by section (§) and pin the branch commit whenever a claim
leans on it.
_Avoid_: the spec (which one?), architecture doc, bible (lowercase — unfindable)

**Zoo**:
The five Exact* curve types of Bible §4.1: CircularArc (the privileged, served
member), cubic Bézier (replacing the Bible's quadratic — §9 amendment A1,
signed off 2026-08-27), EllipticalArc, Clothoid, and single-span NURBS.
Membership criterion: curves living in the wild engines — never "curves that are
easy to prove". The other ISO 13249-3 curve types (SPIRALCURVE's bloss,
biquadratic, sine and cosine; CIRCLE; GEODESICSTRING) are expansion backlog per
Bible §5 Year 5–7, not members.
_Avoid_: curve types (broader), Exact family (vague), ExactCurve (the protocol, not the roster)

**Exact**:
The Bible §2.2 property: the mathematics is closed-form or exactness-preserving and
never densifies silently — what `isExact()` reports. Says nothing about doubles
agreeing across platforms; that different property is Oracle-stable.
_Avoid_: precise, oracle-stable (different property), exact path (see Laser)

**Oracle-stable**:
Agreement across engines and platforms (C++/Java/.NET) in the `clothoid-halley-coq`
golden-vector sense: |value − reference| < 1e-9 on a shared, checked-in corpus
against one designated reference implementation, plus ≥ 99% iteration-count
agreement where the algorithm iterates. An exact formula can still be
oracle-unstable through libm.
_Avoid_: exact (the Bible §2.2 property), stable (unqualified), bit-exact (stronger, rarely achievable)

**Metric length**:
The 1-D measure of a curve — the number the Bible §4.2 `length()` obligation owes and
`LENGTH_UNIFIED` emits. Never confuse it with `List.length`: lemmas named `*_length`
but proved by `length_map` are element counts stating no metric fact.
Bible §4.2 satisfaction (what is proved vs parked) lives in
`docs/scout/508-closing-summary.md`. The zoo is not unconditionally
exact: elliptic E and Fresnel clothoid stay engine-conditional; oracle
`LENGTH_UNIFIED` is still C/A. Owner review retires epic #508.
_Avoid_: length (unqualified where a count could be meant), size,
planned length zoo (the 508-* letters landed), unconditionally exact zoo

### Distance metrics

Function inventory: [`docs/scout/map-hausdorff-functions.md`](docs/scout/map-hausdorff-functions.md).
Formal cluster stays epic #423. Do not remint `423-a`.

**Discrete Hausdorff**:
Vertex (optionally densified-segment) max-min. JTS / NTS / GEOS
`DiscreteHausdorffDistance`. Under-estimates the locus value:
discrete ≤ continuous, and densify fraction → 0 approaches the
locus value. Already on NTS develop.
_Avoid_: Directed Hausdorff, Hausdorff (unqualified), DHD (JTS uses
that abbreviation for both the discrete class and the locus class)

**Oriented discrete**:
One-sided discrete max-min (`orientedDistance` / NTS
`OrientedDistance`). Still vertices or densified chords.
_Avoid_: Directed Hausdorff (the locus class)

**Directed Hausdorff**:
Locus max-min over every point of A, not just vertices. Asymmetric.
JTS `DirectedHausdorffDistance` (JTS #1182). Not on NTS develop
(NTS#812 still open) and not on GEOS. Symmetric Hausdorff is the
max of the two directed values.
_Avoid_: Discrete Hausdorff, oriented discrete, DHD

**Densify fraction**:
Segment-length fraction in `(0, 1]` used by
`DiscreteHausdorffDistance`. Not a map-unit tolerance.
_Avoid_: distance tolerance, accuracy, densify (unqualified)

**Distance tolerance**:
JTS `DirectedHausdorffDistance` accuracy in coordinate units — how
close the realizing pair is to the true max-min. Not a densify
fraction and not a free-end clip.
_Avoid_: densify fraction, clip

**Fully within distance**:
JTS `DirectedHausdorffDistance.isFullyWithinDistance` — every point
of A is within `maxDistance` of B. Not `Geometry.isWithinDistance`
(nearest-point, not Hausdorff).
_Avoid_: isWithinDistance (the nearest-point predicate)

### Performance

**Laser**:
The exact, curve-preserving path — an `Exact*` implementation that keeps a curve
a curve through an operation.
_Avoid_: exact path (ambiguous with exact arithmetic), analytic

**Chainsaw**:
The densify/linearise path — the documented escape hatch that replaces a curve
with segments. The baseline a laser is measured against, never a fallback a
laser may silently take.
_Avoid_: linearization (the act, not the path), fallback, approximation

**Laser ratchet**:
The gate `t_laser ≤ 1.15 × t_chainsaw`, measured **per curve type**. A count of
holding gates is not the ratchet; the ratchet is the timings.
_Avoid_: perf gate (the harness that measures it), benchmark, 1.15 rule

### Packaging

**Package**:
One of the two Rocq theory libraries distributed through opam — assembled from
the corpus by a MANIFEST, shipping `.v` files under the `NTS.Proofs` logpath.
They are **not OCaml libraries**: neither contains a line of OCaml, and the
repo's actual OCaml (the extracted oracle) is unpackaged. "The OCaml libraries"
is a phrase to retire; opam is the OCaml *ecosystem*, not the content.
_Avoid_: OCaml library, module (a package holds many), extraction

**Mint**:
A published release of a Package that is **installable from the Rocq opam
archive**. A GitHub release with an attached tarball is not a mint — six of
those exist and none reached the archive.
_Avoid_: release (ambiguous with the GitHub artifact), tag, publish

**Release bar**:
A named checklist plus the gate evidence each line cites, on a pinned corpus
commit, that a Mint must clear. A checklist with no verdict line is a
suggestion; a bar says what it omits.
_Avoid_: definition of done, acceptance criteria, gate (a gate is one line of a bar)

**MMF**:
Minimum Marketable Feature — imported from the `grootstebozewolf/jts` fork,
where it names a release bar plus published gate numbers on a named mint. Here
it means the smallest release a stranger can install and use, which is why
opam-installability is load-bearing rather than cosmetic. The fork's own gates
are not inherited.
_Avoid_: MVP, milestone, marketable (alone — the constraint is *minimum*)

### Differential tooling

**Oracle**:
The Rocq-extracted reference binary that answers geometric queries over a text
line protocol; the source of truth every engine is compared against.
_Avoid_: reference implementation, ground truth binary

**Harness**:
A runner that puts one engine's answers against the Oracle's on the same inputs
and emits an ok/warn/bug verdict summary.
_Avoid_: test suite, driver

### Interior and boundary

Per **ADR-0003**, "inside a ring" is two-tier. Always say which tier a claim is in.

**Specified interior**:
The OGC **open** interior — `0 < gtri` for a triangle, a strict box for a
rectangle. What DE-9IM matrices and predicates are stated against.
_Avoid_: interior (unqualified), inside

**Computed interior**:
The **half-open** ray-parity region — `point_in_ring` via `edge_crosses_ray`.
What the algorithms and the oracle evaluate. A left edge counts, a right edge does
not; it is not an OGC interior and a theorem over it states no OGC fact.
_Avoid_: interior (unqualified), point_set (as if it were the specification)

**Interior bridge**:
The guarded route from computed to specified interior
(`gtri_point_in_ring_imp_pos` and siblings). Its guards — `ring_complement`,
`ray_avoids_vertices` — are **permanent and load-bearing**, proven maximal by a
Qed refutation of the guard-free form.
_Avoid_: deferral, side condition (both imply temporary)

### Relate regimes

**Regime**:
A named coarse configuration of a geometry pair — separated, partial overlap,
containment, edge touch, vertex touch — that selects one witness DE-9IM matrix.
The classifier arms are real `gtri`-shaped predicates with pairwise
exclusivity (`RelateMatrixTriangle.v`); `TPR_Unsupported` is a decline record,
not a regime verdict.
_Avoid_: case, mode

**Decline**:
A claim-free answer: the pair is not classified. In Coq that is
`im_unsupported` / `TPR_Unsupported` (supports no `RelatePredicate`). On
the oracle wire that is the token `UNSUPPORTED` in result position, never
a 9-char matrix. A decline is not `FFFFFFFFF`.
_Avoid_: error, unsupported matrix, empty matrix

**Sentinel**:
The honesty marker for a decline (`im_unsupported` in Coq; `UNSUPPORTED`
on the wire). Distinct from a classified disjoint fill. The #530 /
#571 pair is classified disjoint (FFFFFFFFF), not a sentinel.
_Avoid_: default, fallback, catch-all (those hid a wrong matrix)

**Relate bar level**:
How much of a relate claim is proven. Bar 1: the classification itself is
proven true geometry against the specified interior, the fill being the
designated witness matrix. Bar 2: every one of the nine DE-9IM cells is
individually proven true. Spell the bar out in prose; "RBL" is WIP shorthand
only.
_Avoid_: level (unqualified), RBL (in prose)

### Roadmap

**Sequencing park**:
Work deferred because it waits on another lane, not because it is hard. It
graduates the moment its gate lands, so it must record *what* gates it.
_Avoid_: parked (unqualified — says nothing about why)

**Research park**:
Work deferred because there is no statement worth proving yet — no published
true form to aim at. It graduates only when someone finds one.
_Avoid_: research-scale (as a synonym for "multi-session" or "hard"), blocked

**Technique park**:
Work deferred with the statement already written and the evidence strong, missing
only a proof method. It graduates when the method is found, so naming the missing
method *is* the deliverable.
_Avoid_: research park (a statement exists), hard, high-risk

**Witness-scoped**:
Proven for named concrete instances rather than universally. An honest partial
result, and this corpus's most reliable route to a usable headline — not a
weaker form of the general claim.
_Avoid_: partial, example-based

### Illustrator

**Case**:
A pair of WKT geometries plus an operation under scrutiny — the question a
sketch answers.
_Avoid_: scenario, example, fixture

**Scenario**:
The composed, drawable form of a Case: linearized geometries, the operation
result, overshoot extracts, and the fit of world coordinates onto a grid.
_Avoid_: scene, model

**Doc**:
The device-independent styled text of a Scenario — lines of colored runs
(header, legend, framed panels). What every Printer consumes.
_Avoid_: styled document, frame buffer, output text

**Printer**:
An adapter that turns a Doc into one concrete medium: ANSI terminal text, or a
PNG facsimile.
_Avoid_: presenter, renderer, emitter, writer

**Facsimile**:
A pixel rendering of a Doc that shows exactly what the terminal shows — the
reproducible replacement for a manual screenshot.
_Avoid_: screenshot (the manual act it replaces), export

**Sketch**:
The human-visible picture of a Case, in whatever medium a Printer produced.
_Avoid_: diagram, illustration, art

**Layer**:
One of the named strata a grid cell can carry: A, B, result, A∩B, A-overshoot,
B-overshoot, and the surface-interior fills of A and B.
_Avoid_: channel, plane

**Overshoot**:
Self-overlap of a single input after linearization — e.g. a CIRCULARSTRING
whose second arc retraces the first.
_Avoid_: self-intersection (narrower), retrace (one kind of overshoot)
