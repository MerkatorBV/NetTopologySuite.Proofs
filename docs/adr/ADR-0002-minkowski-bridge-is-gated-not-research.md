## Context

> lives in the **`jts-*` fork clones**, not in this repository. It is not
> load-bearing for this ADR.

Issue #65's round-2 queue listed **P2 Minkowski point-set semantics** as
*"parked (research-scale; pinned by `gen_buffer_region_tests.py`)"*. That label
was challenged before being carried into the successor epic, and it does not
survive contact with the corpus.

What the tree actually contains:

- **The semantics is already formalised.** `theories/BufferCorrectness.v:57`
  defines the Minkowski dilation directly —
  `buffer_spec g d p := exists q, point_set g q /\ dist p q <= d`, i.e.
  `buffer(g,d) = { p | dist(p,g) ≤ d }` — with two Qed theorems giving it
  content: `buffer_contains_input` (:70) and `buffer_spec_monotone`.
- **Proven Minkowski machinery exists elsewhere.**
  `theories/PenetrationMinimax.v:78 interval_minkowski_diff` (1-D Minkowski
  difference is the sum of half-widths, `Print Assumptions` at :291), consumed by
  `theories/PenetrationGauge.v`.
- **A differential pin already exists.** `oracle/gen_buffer_region_tests.py`
  generates an independent dense-Minkowski reference, cited by
  `theories/CurveBufferArea.v:29-31`.
- **The corpus's own cost assessment is not "research".**
  `docs/audit-rgr-comparison.md:640` rates P2 as value **high** ("the buffer
  point-set headline"), risk **medium–high** — *"needs H1-adjacent analytic
  machinery; sequence AFTER P5"* — cost **multi-session**. §8.3 decision 3 reads
  *"Sequence P2 (Minkowski) after P5"*, and decision 2 notes that P5
  *"additionally unlocks P2"*.

For comparison, the items this corpus genuinely parks for research reasons are
P11–13, and the reason given for the arc-Hobby analog is that there is **"no
published true statement"**. That is the bar "research-scale" denotes here, and
P2 does not meet it.

## Decision

**P2 is reclassified from *research-scale / parked* to *dependency-gated,
multi-session, partially unblocked*.** It is carried inside the buffer
hero-shot epic as that epic's semantic foundation, not as standalone backlog and
not as a research park.

Two further findings shape how it is carried:

1. **The gate is already partly open.** P5's residual `even_parity_escapes` is
   Qed for concrete shape families — `theories/JCTSeparation.v:113
   rect_even_parity_escapes`, `:141 gtri_even_parity_escapes` (general triangle),
   `:156 rtri_even_parity_escapes` — and
   `theories/JCTEscapeDescent.v:279 even_parity_escapes_of_descent` reduces the
   general case to a descent that still carries `ray_avoids_vertices`
   (`theories/HalfOpenTrapped.v:30`). Only the fully general simple-ring case is
   outstanding.
2. **A witness-scoped bridge is therefore available now.** The shape families
   already discharged are exactly the ones a demonstration uses. A Minkowski
   bridge scoped to those shapes needs no new analytic machinery, and it matches
   the corpus's most reliable idiom — *"bounded structural slice with a usable
   headline"* (`audit-rgr-comparison.md` §8.2), the pattern that landed eight
   curve-offset rungs in two days.

## Consequences

- The successor epic must state the Minkowski bridge as an **ask with a
  witness-scoped first slice**, not as a parked item. Anyone reading "parked"
  would otherwise skip the reachable part.
- Terminology is now load-bearing: in this corpus **"research-scale" means no
  published true statement to aim at**, and must not be used for work that is
  merely multi-session or gated behind another lane.

### Amendment, 2026-08-22 — three park kinds, keyed on what is missing

Applying this ADR to issue #66 exposed a third case its original wording could
not name. **C2** (general-binary64 rounded-filter completeness) has a precise
Coq statement already written out (`b64_passes_through_complete_compute`,
`docs/oracle-soundness-finding.md:128-133`) and overwhelming evidence — zero
violations across 36,864 exhaustive, 217,728 ULP-band and 18M random trials —
yet is blocked because round-to-nearest gives no outward guarantee, so
`b64_le_complete`'s hypothesis is exactly what monotonicity cannot supply. That
is neither a missing gate nor a missing statement.

Parks are therefore classified by **what is missing**, because that is the only
axis that predicts how a park graduates:

| Kind | Missing | Graduates when |
|---|---|---|
| **Sequencing park** | a gate — an event, or an owner | the gate lands |
| **Research park** | a statement worth proving | someone finds one |
| **Technique park** | a proof method; statement and evidence are in hand | the method is found |

**Value and priority are orthogonal.** A technique park can be high or low
priority without changing kind. #66's body calls C2 *"high risk, low marginal
value"* while `oracle-soundness-finding.md` records *"proof BLOCKED"* for a
specific technical reason — both true, and only the second tells you what would
unblock it.

Worked examples in this corpus: **sequencing** — the Minkowski bridge (this ADR),
and the `fully_intersected → noded_general_position` bridge, which is *ownerless*
rather than hard. **Research** — the arc-Hobby analog, *"no published true
statement"*, this ADR's calibration point. **Technique** — C2, and the C1 width
extension, whose target is now nameable as a **rounding-tie-freeness lemma** on
the Liang-Barsky quotient family (the comparator `rat_le_iff` is already Qed),
where "high risk" had told nobody anything.
- The general simple-ring `even_parity_escapes` case remains the gate for the
  *unrestricted* bridge, and stays where it is (P5, the JCT escape descent).
- No claim in `docs/verified-claims.md` changes: nothing here proves anything
  new, it reclassifies what remains to be proven.
