# Grill — leftover `Ⅳ` (interior-side stem)

A grilling record. Charted 2026-08-30. This is **not** leftover `Ⅰ`,
**not** leftover `Ⅱ`, **not** leftover `Ⅲ`, and **not** a second copy
of [`map-interior-side-cert.md`](map-interior-side-cert.md) (#629). It
does **not** invent a 12-tuple. It does **not** invent a
side-distinguishing detector. It does **not** remint
`RelateNGCore.v : touch_onesided_t_b`.

> Research chart: [`map-interior-side-cert.md`](map-interior-side-cert.md)

## Destination

**Verify leftover `Ⅳ` against the leftover-`Ⅲ` compile and against
CONTEXT.** Name what holds. Park what does not. Ticket 26 compiled
the residue pair. Do not invent a side-distinguishing detector.

## Verdict

The family is named. Ticket 26 compiled the residue pair
(`RelateNGComplete.v : interior_side_pair_inhabits`). The compiled leftover-`Ⅳ` 12-tuple is
`(0,0)(2,0)(0,1)` vs `(1,0)(5/4,1/4)(3/4,1/4)`.
The compiled one-sided pair is leftover `Ⅲ`
(`RelateNGComplete.v : onesided_t_pair_inhabits`) — exterior-side,
II empty (`RelateNGComplete.v : onesided_t_ii_empty`). The xor
(`RelateNGCore.v : touch_onesided_t_b`) is a `Ⅲ∨Ⅳ` configuration
class with that one exterior witness
(`RelateNGTouchOnesided.v : triangle_pair_regime_onesided`). It is
not side-aware. Ticket 22's leftover-`Ⅲ` bar is met. “Detector for
leftover `Ⅲ`” is not, and this grill does not make it one.

`overlap_b` sits earlier (`RelateNGCore.v : overlap_b`;
`RelateNGCore.v : triangle_pair_regime`). A same-side stem with a
strict-interior B-vertex and a strict-exterior B-vertex is leftover
`522-b`, not this leftover. The residue is same-side xor-true pairs
that miss `overlap_b` / `contains_b` / leftover `Ⅰ`. Whether that
residue is inhabited is **open**. Completeness stays false on leftover
`Ⅱ` (`RelateNGComplete.v : triangle_pair_regime_ccw_incomplete`).
CONTEXT **Bar 1** needs a classified leftover-`Ⅳ` pair and a
designated witness matrix. There is neither. Fill stays
`im_unsupported` (`RelateNGTouchOnesided.v : onesided_fill_still_unsupported`).
This is a **research park** (ADR-0002).

This grill does not mint a pair and call it the spec.

## Claims grilled live

### 1. Residue pair compiled (ticket 26)

**Superseded by ticket 26.** The leftover-`Ⅲ` pair remains
exterior-side (`RelateNGComplete.v : onesided_t_pair_inhabits`).
The interior-side 12-tuple is now
`RelateNGComplete.v : interior_side_pair_inhabits`. The other compiled leftovers are leftover `Ⅰ`
(`RelateNGTouchPartialEdge.v : triangle_pair_regime_touchpartial`)
and leftover `Ⅱ`
(`RelateNGComplete.v : triangle_pair_regime_ccw_incomplete_not_tjunction`).
`classified_hard_pairs` is four rows. None of those is this family.

### 2. Leftover `Ⅲ` is the opposite-side witness, not this leftover

**Confirmed.**

| Finding | Leftover | Why not `Ⅳ` |
|---|---|---|
| `RelateNGComplete.v : onesided_t_pair_inhabits` | `Ⅲ` | Exterior-side. Contact `(1,0)` on A's base `y = 0`. II empty (`RelateNGComplete.v : onesided_t_ii_empty`). There is no `onesided_t_bb_dim0`. |
| `RelateNGTouchPartialEdge.v : triangle_pair_regime_touchpartial` | `Ⅰ` | Mutual. Same-side sliver. II = 2, BB = 1. |
| `RelateNGComplete.v : triangle_pair_regime_ccw_incomplete_not_tjunction` | `Ⅱ` | Shared vertex; cone `side_dot = 0`. |

### 3. The xor is `Ⅲ∨Ⅳ`, not a leftover-`Ⅳ` detector

**Confirmed.** `RelateNGCore.v : touch_onesided_t_b` is
`xorb (some_vertex_on_open_edges A B) (some_vertex_on_open_edges B A)`.
No side test. True on leftover `Ⅲ`. True on leftover `Ⅳ`
(`RelateNGComplete.v : interior_side_onesided_true`). Classifier order
(`RelateNGCore.v : triangle_pair_regime`) emits `TPR_TouchOnesided`
for any xor-true pair that missed the earlier arms. Do **not** remint
the xor. A side-distinguishing boolean, if asked later, tests the
side of the supporting line **after** the xor.

### 4. `overlap_b` may steal same-side stems

**Confirmed.** `RelateNGCore.v : overlap_b` needs a B-vertex with
`0 < gtri A` and a B-vertex with `gtri A < 0`, plus a vertex of A
strictly exterior to B. A same-side stem can fire that arm. Those
pairs are leftover `522-b`
(`RelateNGComplete.v : classified_overlap_pair`), not leftover `Ⅳ`.
The residue is same-side one-sided pairs that miss this arm.

| Detector | Why it is the wrong tool for leftover `Ⅳ` |
|---|---|
| `touch_edge_b` | `RelateNGCore.v : shares_edge_b` is endpoint-pair equality. A T is not a full shared edge. |
| `contains_b` | Needs `0 < gtri A` at every B-vertex. A stem on the supporting line has `gtri = 0`. |
| `overlap_b` | May fire. Those pairs are leftover `522-b`. |
| `separated_b` | A supporting-edge separator is a disjoint witness. A T is contact. |
| `touch_vertex_b` | Needs a shared vertex and `RelateNGCore.v : cone_separates_b`. This family has **no** shared vertex. |
| `touch_partial_edge_b` | Mutual. Leftover `Ⅰ`. This family is one-sided. |
| `touch_onesided_t_b` | True on leftover `Ⅲ` and leftover `Ⅳ`. No side test. |

### 5. CONTEXT Bar 1 is not applicable

**Confirmed miss — not a failed bar, an absent subject.** Bar 1 needs
a classified leftover-`Ⅳ` pair **and** a designated witness matrix.
The pair is compiled (`RelateNGComplete.v : interior_side_pair_inhabits`).
There is no leftover-`Ⅳ` matrix. The constructor is already on
`im_unsupported`. `classify_triangle_pair` arm for
`TPR_TouchOnesided` is `True` — leftover `Ⅰ` honesty, not CONTEXT
Bar 1. Nothing that mentions `TPR_TouchOnesided` may be proved
through `classify_triangle_pair`. Decline golden is leftover `Ⅱ`.
Do not emit `FFFFFFFFF`. Do not emit `FFFF1FFF2` or `FF2F11212` on
`TPR_TouchOnesided` — leftover `Ⅲ` looks like areal Touches,
leftover `Ⅳ` looks like overlap. The fill token is the only thing
keeping those families from mixing.

### 6. Residue inhabited

**Superseded by ticket 26.** The residue pair reaches
`TPR_TouchOnesided` (`RelateNGTouchOnesided.v : triangle_pair_regime_interior_side`).
`overlap_b` is false (`RelateNGComplete.v : interior_side_overlap_b_false`).
II nonempty (`RelateNGComplete.v : interior_side_ii_nonempty`).

## Parks (ADR-0002)

- **Research:** residue pair compiled
  (`RelateNGComplete.v : interior_side_pair_inhabits`).
- **Sequencing:** side-distinguishing detector, constructor split,
  fill. All gated on the research park **and** an owner ask. The xor
  is already compiled. Do not invent a second detector as the first
  implement letter.
- **Technique:** none. There is no leftover-`Ⅳ` detector statement
  to grill.

## Not this leftover

Not leftover `Ⅰ` / #609. Not leftover `Ⅱ` / #611. Not leftover
`Ⅲ` / #628. Not #570 overlap. Not #572 TouchVertex. Not line×line
IB. Not a remint of `aa_matrix_*`. Not a remint of
`touch_onesided_t_b`. Do not mint `522-n`. Do not mint `Ⅴ`. Do not
steal `522-j` / `522-m` / `522-f` / `522-i` / `522-b`.

## If `/implement Ⅳ` is asked

Ticket 26 compiled the residue. Do not remint the xor. Do not remint
the fill. Completeness stays false on leftover `Ⅱ` until proved.

## Decisions so far

- Family named — #629 / [`map-interior-side-cert.md`](map-interior-side-cert.md).
- Leftover `Ⅲ` compile — #628 /
  `RelateNGTouchOnesided.v : triangle_pair_regime_onesided`.
  `Ⅲ∨Ⅳ` xor, two witnesses, fill token, completeness still `Ⅱ`.
- This grill — named; Bar 1 not applicable (no matrix).
- Ticket 26 — residue pair
  `RelateNGComplete.v : interior_side_pair_inhabits`.
- Spec / tickets — [`spec-interior-side.md`](spec-interior-side.md);
  scout 23–26 closed.
