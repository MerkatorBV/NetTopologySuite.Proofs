# Generate dashboard/index.html — the in-repo "observatory" for the Proofs
# corpus.  It reports ONLY on data that exists in this repository:
#
#   - docs/verified-claims.md   (citable theorem index + regime tags)
#   - TRIAGE_NTS_JTS_ISSUES.md  (per-issue #64-#69 status table)
#   - oracle/*_vectors.txt, *_tests.txt  (differential test vectors)
#   - docs/admitted-*.txt, axiom-allowlist.txt, oracle-handrolled-allowlist.txt
#
# It is deliberately NOT a JTS/NTS test runner.  This corpus is the *oracle /
# reference* (the cross-project differential harness lives downstream in
# NetTopologySuite.Curve); the dashboard deep-links out to JTS/NTS rather than
# pretending to execute them.  The page preserves the corpus's honest
# proven / conditional / deferred distinctions — no flattened "all green".
#
# Self-contained: emits one HTML file with inline CSS, no network/CDN deps,
# no build step.  Re-run on every push via .github/workflows/pages.yml.
#
# Usage:  python3 scripts/gen_dashboard.py            # writes dashboard/index.html

    <h2>Feature × geometry-type coverage</h2>
    <p class="muted">Which NTS operations have mechanically-verified proofs for
      each curve geometry type. Column headers:
      <b>CS</b>&nbsp;=&nbsp;CircularString, <b>CC</b>&nbsp;=&nbsp;CompoundCurve,

      <b>Multi</b>&nbsp;=&nbsp;MultiCurve&nbsp;/&nbsp;MultiSurface — the
      abbreviations used by the <code>grootstebozewolf/jts</code> fork, so a row
      reads the same in both trackers. <b>Arc</b>&nbsp;=&nbsp;CircularArc is this
      corpus's single-arc <em>primitive</em>, not a geometry type: an Arc theorem
      is not a CS theorem until something concatenates it.
      Hover a cell for the source-of-record lemma or the reason it is empty.</p>
    <p class="muted">Read the icons with care: they are driven by theorem and
      oracle-tag <em>counts</em>, and every <code>red_*_unified_tests.py</code>
      file carries one blanket <code>geom:arc,cs,cc,cp,multi</code> tag, so a
      single unified file credits itself to all five columns at once. The hover
      note is the honest per-column reading.</p>
